# Pinball-Bot

A simple Bot that hits the Ball when it gets close to one of the 2 flippers.

## How to use
 
The Bot first scans the Ram for the values needed to determine the balls position, 
this does not suceed everytime just restart the game and try again if it fails.
For the scanning at the start the ball needs to be resting in the start position. 
The scanning itself can take 30-90 sec. If it says "Correct memory found" you can start the ball and watch the bot use the flippers. 

##Development
* With proper pointers to the balls position the scanning can be skipped, but i didnt find any.
* A faster memory scanning method would greatly improve life-quality.
* I stopped working on this due to the game having collision problems, but i would appreciate any commits :D
