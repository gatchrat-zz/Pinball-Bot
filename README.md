# Pinball-Bot

A simple Bot that hits the Ball when it gets close to one of the 2 flippers.

The Bot first scans the Ram for the values needed to determine the balls position, 
this does not suceed everytime just restart the game and try again if it fails.
For the scanning at the start the ball needs to be resting in the start position. 
The scanning itself can take 30-90 sec.
